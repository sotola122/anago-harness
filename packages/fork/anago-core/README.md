## Summary

The host capability layer for anago profiles: memory, the LLM wiki, the Japanese-response instruction, the Cursor subagent, and the Exa and Brave search providers. The package carries no runtime code; its substance is `cordis.patch.yml`, declared by the `dsh.bundle.patch` manifest field.

## Use this package

Mount it after the upstream bundles in `dsh.profile.bundles`. It also pins the default search provider to `exa` and restates `fetchProvider: http`, because a row patch replaces the whole `config`.

| Row | Package |
|---|---|
| `memory` | `@anago-harness/memory` |
| `llm-wiki` | `@anago-harness/llm-wiki` |
| `response-language` | `@anago-harness/response-language` |
| `subagent-cursor` | `@anago-harness/subagent-cursor` |
| `tool-subagent-cursor` | `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-subagent` |
| `web-search-exa` | `@anago-harness/web-search-exa` |
| `web-search-brave` | `@anago-harness/web-search-brave` |

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The profile composer reads the bundle's patch and applies it after the upstream bundle layers, then applies the profile's own patch. A non-insert entry replaces the targeted row's `config` wholesale. Rows stay switchable from the Plugins page; turn one off in `cordis.patch.yml` with `- id: <row>` and `disabled: true`.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

Indirectly, through each inserted row's package, which owns that row's model-facing behavior.

#### KV Cache effect

The bundle itself adds no request prefix; each inserted row's package owns any cache effect.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The bundle is private to this fork and is not published to npm.
- Its rows are ordinary profile rows; a deployment that removes the bundle also removes every capability it mounts.
