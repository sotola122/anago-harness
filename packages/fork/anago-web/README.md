English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The browser layer for anago profiles: the Exa and Brave web-search settings cards on the Plugins page. The package carries no runtime code; its substance is `cordis.patch.yml`, declared by the `dsh.bundle.patch` manifest field.

## Use this package

Mount it after `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app`. The patch also disables the upstream DeepSeek search card while the DeepSeek search rows remain in the base composition, because all of them write the same `web.searchProvider` field.

| Row | Package |
|---|---|
| `ui-settings-web-search-providers` | `@anago-harness/client-ui-settings-web-search` |

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The profile composer reads the bundle's patch and applies it after the upstream bundle layers, then applies the profile's own patch. A non-insert entry replaces the targeted row's `config` wholesale. Rows stay switchable from the Plugins page; turn one off in `cordis.patch.yml` with `- id: <row>` and `disabled: true`.

## Further Exploration

- [fork group](../README.md) — the package map for this group.
- [Design of the bundled plugins](../../../ANAGO_PLUGINS_DESIGN.md) — package split and settings cards.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

Indirectly, through each inserted row's package, which owns that row's model-facing behavior.

#### KV Cache effect

The bundle itself adds no request prefix; each inserted row's package owns any cache effect.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The bundle is private to this fork and is not published to npm.
- Its rows are ordinary profile rows; a deployment that removes the bundle also removes every capability it mounts.
