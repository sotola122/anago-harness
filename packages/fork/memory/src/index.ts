/**
 * R1 and R2: persistent memory for DSH.
 *
 * The plugin owns three Markdown stores and six seams:
 *
 * | piece | what it does | design |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `memory` tool | 0–8 add/patch/remove operations, applied under the writer lock, all or nothing | §4.1 |
 * | `agent/pre-step` | one frozen snapshot per session, inserted after `next()` | §4.2 |
 * | `agent/created` | a subagent child gets the workspace store only, and reads it read-only | §4.4, N8 |
 * | `tools/pre-execute` | `writeApproval: ask`: ask, or mark the call staged under `never` | §4.5 |
 * | `/memory` | list, show, path, pending, approve, reject, gitignore | §4.6 |
 * | turn-end review | completed turns accumulate and are drained at `agent/status` idle, always staged | §4.7 |
 * | workspace store | `<projectRoot>/.dsh/memory/MEMORY.md`, git root required, `.gitignore` block managed | §5.1 |
 *
 * The review is deliberately wired as three listeners rather than one: the
 * count rides `session/event` (`turn/end` with `reason.kind === 'completed'`),
 * the drain rides `agent/status` (the only place where the agent is known to be
 * idle **and** the round can read the conversation), and `agent/disposed`
 * cancels a round whose agent went away. None of them is awaited by the caller,
 * and `agent/turn-stopping` and `runMaintenance` are not used: the first would
 * hold the turn and the second would hold later input (S24).
 *
 * The one defense this plugin has for memory content is the §9 scan at
 * injection time (and at write time, and again when a staged write is
 * approved): memory paths are **not** denied to `write`/`edit`/`bash`, because
 * `bash` can write them anyway and a deny would only hide the real boundary
 * (N2, §5.2). The review adds two more places the same scan runs: the excerpt
 * before it is sent (a refusal skips that round) and the model's proposal
 * before it is staged (through the tool's own `applyOperations`).
 * @module @anago-harness/memory
