/**
 * Staged writes: `$DSH_HOME/memories/pending/` (DESIGN §4.5, sixth revision).
 *
 * When the session's effective approval policy is `never`, `writeApproval:
 * ask` cannot ask anyone, so every operation of a `memory` call is recorded as
 * a `PendingOp` instead of being written. The records live **outside the
 * working tree**, under the harness home, which is what keeps them out of a
 * `workspace-write` sandbox (`bash` cannot write there, S18):
 *
 * ```text
 * $DSH_HOME/memories/pending/
 * ├── memory/<id>.json                     target 'memory'
 * ├── user/<id>.json                       target 'user'
 * └── workspaces/<sha256(root)>/<id>.json  target 'workspace'
 * ```
 *
 * The store directories are the pending scope: the two global ones always, and
 * for a workspace one only the key of the repository the session is in, so an
 * id from another repository is not addressable here. There is deliberately
 * **no `issued.json`** (removed in the sixth revision): an id is accepted when
 * its form is right, its file is directly inside an addressable pending
 * directory, its JSON `id` equals the file name, and its shape is exactly
 * {@link PendingOp}. The body's authenticity is not verified — anyone who can
 * write the directory can plant a well-formed file (§9).
 *
 * Approval re-checks everything inside the store's writer lock and runs the
 * **same** §9 scan, delimiter, duplicate, and limit functions the direct write
 * path uses: `patch`/`remove` require the whole `baseEntry` recorded at staging
 * time to still be present, and `add` must still be duplicate-free and within
 * the limit. A refusal there means the store moved on, so the pending file is
 * removed and `MEMORY_PENDING_STALE` is reported (hermes parity). Approvals are
 * per operation: the batch atomicity of a direct write is **not** kept, because
 * each staged operation is applied by its own locked read-modify-write.
 * @module @anago-harness/memory/pending
