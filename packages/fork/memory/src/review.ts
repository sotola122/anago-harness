/**
 * The turn-end review (DESIGN §4.7, sixth revision).
 *
 * After a conversation the plugin asks a small auxiliary model call whether
 * anything in it belongs in memory. The trigger is the drain point the design
 * settled on:
 *
 * ```text
 * turn/end (completed)  ──count──▶  accumulation  ──agent/status = idle──▶  1 attempt
 * ```
 *
 * - **Counting** is by completed turns, not by idle occurrences: `idle` is
 *   emitted for other reasons too, and `runMaintenance` would hold later input
 *   (S24). A turn that ended `aborted`, `error`, `max-tokens`, or `blocked`
 *   never counts.
 * - **Persistence** is the sidecar `$DSH_HOME/memories/review/<sha256(id)>.json`
 *   with `{reviewRuns, consumedCompleted, fullNotified, lastOutcome}` (the file
 *   `/memory list` already reads). `reviewRuns` is **attempts**, failures
 *   included: it is incremented and written **before** the stream call, so a
 *   round that dies mid-call still spent one of the session's four.
 * - **Non-blocking**: the listener returns immediately and the review runs on
 *   its own; nothing here touches the running turn's signal. Cancellation is a
 *   dedicated `AbortController`, aborted by `timeoutMs`, by `agent/disposed`,
 *   and by the plugin's disposer. One review runs per **plugin instance** at a
 *   time, and the disposer aborts and awaits it before the fiber is disposed.
 * - **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: immediately before dispatch, the exact request
 *   (route, system, messages, token cap, and reasoning effort) is appended as
 *   the log-only `memory/review-request` event. The response is not logged.
 * - **Always staged** (U2): a proposal that passes the `memory` tool's own
 *   validation is recorded as pending operations with `source: 'review'`, which
 *   `/memory approve` applies. Nothing is written directly.
 * - **Failures are quiet**: a timeout, a stream error, unparseable output, or a
 *   refused operation discards that round with a warning line and no retry.
 *
 * What the design asks for beyond this module: §4.7 folds the whole log in a
 * host-only session projection (`memoryReviewTurns`) so the completed count is
 * absolute. This implementation accumulates the same `turn/end` events on
 * `session/event` instead, and keeps the *consumed* count absolute through the
 * sidecar (`reviewRuns` and `consumedCompleted` cross a resume exactly as the
 * design specifies). The reason is the package's declared peer set (§3.1): it
 * has no `dsh-session-projection`, and the only other way to fold a resumed log
 * is the deprecated `eventAt` family (S24, `作法`). The residual difference is
 * bounded and one-directional: completed turns from before this process started
 * are not re-counted, so a resumed session needs up to `everyTurns` fresh turns
 * where the projection would have drained the old remainder immediately.
