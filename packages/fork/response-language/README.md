## Model Experience

### Japanese response instruction

#### What the model sees

One system-prompt section (`response-language`, order 9950) whose fixed text begins `Always write your replies to the user in Japanese (日本語)`. Subagent children and assemblies without an agent receive an empty section, which rendering drops.

#### Token effect

A fixed cost of roughly 60 tokens in every request from a main agent on the standard, ptc, or cordis presets; the section is absent for `minimal` and for delegated children.

#### KV Cache effect

The section is part of the stable prompt prefix, so its text is cacheable across turns. Turning `enabled` off or on changes the prefix once, and later requests reuse the new prefix.
