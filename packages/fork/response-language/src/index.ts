 *
 * - a subagent child (`session.header.delegationDepth > 0`) gets `''`, so the
 *   empty section is dropped by rendering and agent↔subagent traffic stays in

 * - an assembly without `agent` (diagnostics, plan-mode lookalikes) gets `''`
 *   too, because there is no session whose role could justify the instruction.
 * - `enabled: false` turns the section off without removing the profile row.
